Git and CS account setup help from Alice Lee('17) and Arthur Berman('16). All html and css code written by myself (Lani Godenzi). Some CSS reference from w3schools.com specifically about the <a> selectors :active, :hover, and :visited. Background image from subtlepatterns.com/knitted-sweater/ by Victora Spahn.

Project took ~6hrs to complete, including setup of Github account and download of Git and virtual machine (mostly done during the superbowl).
